# thesis-subprojects

This repository contains various projects that were part of my master's thesis. 
The thesis was about benchmarking the performance of network devices, with a focus 
on real-time applications. 

In addition to this repository, there is also a fork of the TRex packet generator, 
located at [KHTangent/trex-core](https://github.com/KHTangent/trex-core). This fork 
contains a version of TRex that has been modified to export individual packet timestamps, 
for use with the packet-postprocessor in this repository.

The subfolders of this repository are: 

* `data-postprocessor`: A tool for processing the data that is generated by the packet
  generator. It is a Rust application that uses Plotters.rs to efficiently generate plots.
* `testbed-docs`: A guide describing how to set up and configure a testbed similar to 
  the one we used in the thesis.
* `scripts`: A collection of scripts, mostly for personal use. It contains two attempts at 
  processing the data generated by the packet generator, but it is not efficient enough, 
  so the Rust application should be used instead. It also contains some scripts used for 
  generating plots in the thesis, but these are not useful by themselves, as they are a bit 
  specific to the data collected in the thesis.
* `trex-batcher`: A script we used for batching multiple tests with TRex, and move the 
  generated data blobs to appropriate folders. It is provided as an example, and is not 
  usable directly.
